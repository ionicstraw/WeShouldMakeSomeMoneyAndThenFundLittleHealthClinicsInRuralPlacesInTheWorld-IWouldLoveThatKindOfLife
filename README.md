# WeShouldMakeSomeMoneyAndThenFundLittleHealthClinicsInRuralPlacesInTheWorld-IWouldLoveThatKindOfLife

my brother and his wife were sharing stories from italy for hours, but he said, they would talk to some of the shop owners that were immigrants, and they have these stories of arriving there on a boat ... and i was like, its so sad theres so much poverty in the world, like they immigrated from their home country bc they couldnt live there anymore

oo maybe theres some grant out there, to bring like portable clincal sequencing to rural parts of the world, powered by solar power and using starlink for the internet, something like that i dunno

b4 i go to sleep -- ok i will mention like 2 sentences about this in my personal statement

using [starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) to submit clinical sequencing data (maybe from nanopore) into diagnosis cloud pipelines in remote parts of the world where internet is limited, that's the general idea

could be a paper i dunno, i dunno if this idea exists

we should buy some property in like france ... south of france, theres some show on netflix where they buy real estate in france forgot what its called, i should watch it to escape the news of whats going on here
